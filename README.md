The current outline is as follows:

Reference paper: (Kercheval and Zhang, 2015)

Goal:

We want to build on the research conducted by (Kercheval and Zhang, 2015), by considering alternative variations of logistic regression and alternative models for the task of predicting the probability of observing a positive price sign in period i+j,P(yi+j=1| Xi ), withj =0,1,5,10 as an example.
Furthermore, we want to quantify the effect of using bootstrap versus cross-validation in the training phase of the model building process. 
Lastly, we want to touch on online prediction in the context of price direction prediction using LOB data.

Summary:

* We want to build on the research conducted by (Kercheval and Zhang, 2015).
* We want to consider alternative variations of Logistic Regression and alternative models (Random Forest and/or Neural Networks).
* We want to discuss/quantify the effect of using bootstrap versus cross-validation in training/estimation phase on LOB data and more generally on time series data.
* We want to consider the use of online prediction in the context of price direction prediction using LOB data.
