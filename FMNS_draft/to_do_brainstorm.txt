to do thesis:
D - candlesticking should accept smaller bars than 1 min
D - all features should depend on FeatureWindow (get x lags for each feature, not just pastObs)
D - Add bollinger bands
- preprocessing: 1) min-max, 2) standardization (std 1), 3) normalization (mean 0, std 1), 4) simple latest-close difference, 5) last-close difference + standardization
--> maybe two parameters: 1) last-close difference | raw, 2) min-max | std | norm
--> remember preprocessing is trained on train fold and transforming in test fold
SD --> do proper slicing to remove burn-in before preprocessing
----> needs more work but done for now
W - add calendar features (weekday, clock)
- for CV runs: basic shuffling, basic time-series CV, some bootstrap
--> which scorer? AUC?
- any feature selection?
--> try Marco's approach


SD - we might need to postpone the 30 min cutoff until late, as we should use them as bridge between day close bars and 9:30 bars for features
SD --> candle extraction can now do sample == 'full'. Then we need burn-in to take it into account (continue from previous day's close bars)
